Deandra Neretlis has enjoyed acting from a young age, joining various acting camps, Second City classes, and taking drama throughout all of High School. It wasn't until she hit the stage in <strong> <em>That's the Spirit</em> </strong>did she realize how much joy she took in the process of acting as part of a full play. She took part in another school play in Grade 12, learning then that this was the path she wished to pursue. Deandra was accepted into the University of Toronto's Drama program and joined several other productions with the UC Follies and WolfPac.

Although Deandra didn't stay in this program, she took a much needed shift into another deeply engrained passion - her writing. From the age of fifteen, Deandra has been working on a 
Young Adult multiple-perspective novel which she continues to work on to this day. During her time away from the acting world, Deandra still yearned to return to the stage. Before long, she returned to Second City, completing their five-part Improv program.
         </p>
         <p>
She found there was one passion missing from her studies - her desire to learn more about film acting. She earned a place in Seneca's Acting for Camera and Voice program, graduating with honours. While learning about the world of film acting, she learned about the incredible work it takes to create each character's story. While she is determined to delve deeper with character studies in future roles, she's eager to work on her novel still pending completion. She is currently working on her trilogy while beginning to explore new story ideas for screenplays.
